# 🌐 Updated Network Configuration

## Current Network Setup

- **Network**: 192.168.123.X (all devices on same network)
- **Mac (Laptop)**: 192.168.123.56 (via ethernet to switch)
- **Robot (PC2)**: 192.168.123.164 (via ethernet to switch)
- **Quest 3**: 192.168.123.133 (via WiFi, same network)

## ✅ This Configuration is Fine!

The Quest IP change doesn't matter at all. As long as all devices are on the same network (192.168.123.X), everything will work.

## How It Works

1. **Quest 3** (192.168.123.133) connects to **Mac** (192.168.123.56:8012) via WebSocket
2. **Mac** (192.168.123.56) connects to **Robot** (192.168.123.164) via DDS
3. All devices can communicate because they're on the same network

## Quest 3 Connection URL

Open this in Quest Browser:

```
https://192.168.123.56:8012/?ws=wss://192.168.123.56:8012
```

(Replace 192.168.123.56 with your actual Mac IP if different)

## Network Topology

```
Quest 3 (WiFi) ──┐
                 ├── Switch ── Mac (Ethernet)
Robot (Ethernet) ┘
```

All on 192.168.123.X network ✅

## No Changes Needed

- Quest IP can be any 192.168.123.X address
- As long as Quest can reach Mac's IP (192.168.123.56), it works
- The Quest doesn't need to directly connect to the robot

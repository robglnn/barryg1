# 🎮 Quick Quest 3 Tips

## Which VR Button?

✅ **Use "Virtual Reality" button IN the Vuer UI** (the page you loaded)
❌ **NOT the browser's "Enter VR" button** (upper right corner)

## Setup Order

1. Load Quest Browser → Go to Vuer URL
2. Click "Virtual Reality" button (in Vuer UI)
3. Press 'r' in terminal

## Hand Tracking Controls

- **Your wrist position** → Robot arm position
- **Your wrist rotation** → Robot wrist rotation
- **Left hand** → Left robot arm
- **Right hand** → Right robot arm

## Why It Feels Unclear

1. **Latency** (~50-100ms) - Normal, but makes feedback unclear
2. **No visual feedback** - Black screen until camera feed (if configured)
3. **Speed ramp-up** - Robot starts slow for safety
4. **Initial position mismatch** - Your arms might not match robot's position

## How to Verify It's Working

1. **Make large, slow movements** with your hands
2. **Watch the robot directly** (not just VR)
3. **Move one hand at a time** - easier to see correlation
4. **Check terminal** - should show continuous activity

## Initial Alignment (IMPORTANT!)

Before pressing 'r', align your arms to match robot:
- Arms slightly down and forward
- Elbows bent
- Hands in front of body

This prevents sudden movements when teleoperation starts!

## If Arms Don't Move

1. Did you press 'r'? (Check terminal)
2. Are your hands visible to Quest cameras?
3. Are arms at joint limits? (Try different position)
4. Check terminal for errors

## Expected Latency

- **50-100ms total** from hand movement to robot response
- This is normal for WiFi + processing
- Make larger movements to see clearer correlation

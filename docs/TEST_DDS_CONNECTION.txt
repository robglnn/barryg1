# 🔍 Test DDS Connection - Single Line Command

## Your Network Interface: en7

## Test DDS Connection (Copy-Paste This):

source /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate xr_teleop && cd ~/unitree_sdk2_python/example/low_level && python3 lowlevel_control.py en7

## What This Does:

- Tests if you can receive low-level state data from the robot via DDS
- If it works, you'll see robot joint states, IMU data, battery voltage
- If it doesn't work, you'll see connection errors

## Expected Output (If Working):

You should see output like:
- Right front leg hip joint state
- IMU readings
- Battery voltage
- Motor states

## If It Fails:

- Robot's DDS service may not be running
- Network interface may be wrong
- Firewall may be blocking DDS

## Quest 3 XR Errors (Normal):

The "No XR hardware found" errors in the browser console are normal when:
- Using a regular browser (not Quest Browser)
- XR features not enabled in browser settings
- Need to use Quest's native browser with XR support

The VR/Pass-through buttons should work once you're in Quest Browser with XR enabled.

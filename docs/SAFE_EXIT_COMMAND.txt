# 🛡️ Safe Exit - Press 'q' in Terminal

## Safest Exit Method

**Press 'q' in the terminal** (not Ctrl+C)

This will:
1. Return arms to home position (~5 seconds)
2. Exit debug mode safely
3. Clean up all connections

## Before Exiting

**Recommended**: Move your hands to neutral position first:
- Arms down at sides
- Elbows slightly bent  
- Hands in front of body

Wait 5-10 seconds for robot to follow, then press 'q'.

## If Arms Are Raised

1. Move your hands down slowly
2. Wait for robot to follow (watch directly)
3. Once arms are down, press 'q'

## Alternative: Keep Script Running

If you want to recharge Quest but keep control:
1. Move hands to neutral
2. Wait for robot to follow
3. Leave script running (robot holds position)
4. Recharge Quest
5. Reconnect when ready

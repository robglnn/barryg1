# 🔍 Test DDS Connection - Single Line Command

## Your Network Interface: en7

## Test DDS Connection (Copy-Paste This):

source /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate xr_teleop && cd /Users/hg/unitree_sdk2_python/example/g1/low_level && python3 g1_low_level_example.py en7

## What This Does:

- Tests if you can receive low-level state data from G1 robot via DDS
- If it works, you'll see robot joint states, IMU data, battery voltage
- If it doesn't work, you'll see connection errors

## Expected Output (If Working):

You should see output like:
- Motor joint states
- IMU readings  
- Battery voltage
- Robot state data

## If It Fails:

- Robot's DDS service may not be running on PC2
- Network interface may be wrong (try other interfaces if en7 doesn't work)
- Firewall may be blocking DDS
- Robot may need high-level service disabled

## Quest 3 XR Errors (Normal):

The "No XR hardware found" errors in browser console are normal. You need to:
- Use **Quest Browser** (not regular browser)
- Enable XR features in Quest Browser settings
- The VR/Pass-through buttons will work once XR is enabled

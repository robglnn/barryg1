# ✅ Script is Ready - Just Need Robot On!

## Current Status

✅ **Script is working correctly!**
- DDS initialized with correct network interface (`en7`)
- Logging is reasonable (once per second)
- Ctrl+C works properly

❌ **Robot is OFF** - That's why DDS can't connect

## What You Need

1. **Turn robot ON**
2. **Put robot in Debug Mode:**
   - Press **L2+R2** simultaneously
   - Then press **L2+A**
   - Wait for robot to beep/indicate debug mode
3. **Run the script again**

## Port 60000 Timeout

**Not a problem!** This is just the camera config server. The script uses local config file instead, which is fine.

## Expected Behavior When Robot is On

Once robot is powered on and in debug mode:
- DDS should connect within 2-5 seconds
- You'll see: `[G1_23_ArmController] DDS connection established!`
- Then: `Subscribe dds ok.`
- Then: `Please enter the start signal (enter 'r' to start the subsequent program)`

## The Command (Ready to Use)

```bash
source /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate xr_teleop && cd /Users/hg/Documents/barryg1/dependencies/xr_teleoperate/teleop && python teleop_hand_and_arm.py --arm=G1_23 --input-mode=hand --display-mode=immersive --img-server-ip=192.168.123.164
```

**Everything is ready - just turn the robot on!** 🤖

# ✅ Ready to Test - Callback-Based DDS Conversion Complete

## What Was Changed

✅ Converted `G1_23_ArmController` from polling to callback-based DDS subscription
✅ Matches the working test script pattern
✅ Memory bank updated

## Test Command

```bash
source /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate xr_teleop && cd /Users/hg/Documents/barryg1/dependencies/xr_teleoperate/teleop && python teleop_hand_and_arm.py --arm=G1_23 --input-mode=hand --display-mode=immersive --img-server-ip=192.168.123.164
```

## Expected Output

1. Script initializes
2. **DDS connects quickly** (within a few seconds) - callback-based is more reliable
3. You'll see: `[G1_23_ArmController] Subscribe dds ok.`
4. Then: `Please enter the start signal (enter 'r' to start the subsequent program)`
5. **Press 'r'** in terminal to start teleoperation
6. VR should show robot's camera feed (if configured)
7. Move your hands - robot should respond!

## Network Info

- Control robot hands with gestures

Good luck! 🚀

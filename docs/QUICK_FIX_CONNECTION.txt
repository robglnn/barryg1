# 🔧 Quick Fix: "Site Can't Be Reached"

## Most Likely Issue: Server Not Running

The Vuer server only runs when the teleoperation script is active!

## Step 1: Start the Teleoperation Script

Run this command in Terminal (keep it running):

```bash
source /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate xr_teleop && cd /Users/hg/Documents/barryg1/dependencies/xr_teleoperate/teleop && python teleop_hand_and_arm.py --arm=G1_23 --input-mode=hand --display-mode=immersive --img-server-ip=192.168.123.164
```

**Wait for it to say:**
- "Serving file://..." 
- "Visit: https://vuer.ai?grid=False"
- Or similar server startup messages

## Step 2: Verify Server is Running

In a NEW terminal window, run:
```bash
lsof -i :8012
```

You should see Python processes listening on port 8012.

## Step 3: Check Mac Firewall

**Temporarily disable firewall to test:**
1. System Settings → Network → Firewall
2. Turn OFF firewall
3. Try connecting from Quest
4. If it works, re-enable and add exception

**Add Firewall Exception (if needed):**
1. System Settings → Network → Firewall → Options
2. Click "+" 
3. Add Python: `/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/envs/xr_teleop/bin/python`
4. Allow incoming connections

## Step 4: Test from Mac First

Before trying Quest, test locally:
- Open Safari on Mac
- Go to: `https://192.168.123.56:8012/?ws=wss://192.168.123.56:8012`
- Accept SSL warning
- If it works on Mac but not Quest = network/firewall issue
- If it doesn't work on Mac = server not running

## Step 5: Connect from Quest

Once server is running and firewall is configured:
1. Put on Quest 3
2. Open Quest Browser
3. Go to: `https://192.168.123.56:8012/?ws=wss://192.168.123.56:8012`
4. Accept SSL warning
5. Should connect!

## Troubleshooting

- **"Site can't be reached"** = Server not running OR firewall blocking
- **Port 8012 not listening** = Script not running or crashed
- **Works on Mac but not Quest** = Firewall blocking external connections

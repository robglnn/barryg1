# Quest Browser Information

## Where to Get Quest Browser

**Quest Browser is built into your Quest 3 headset** - you don't need to download it separately!

## How to Use Quest Browser

1. **Put on your Quest 3 headset**
2. **Open the browser** - Look for "Browser" in your Quest home menu/apps
3. **Navigate to**: `https://192.168.123.56:8012/?ws=wss://192.168.123.56:8012`
   - Replace `192.168.123.56` with your Mac's IP address
4. **Accept the SSL certificate warning** (click "Advanced" → "Proceed")
5. **Click "Virtual Reality" button** - This should work in Quest Browser (not regular PC browsers)

## Important Notes

- **Quest Browser runs on the VR headset**, not on your PC
- The "No XR hardware found" errors you saw were because you were using a regular browser (on PC or Quest without XR enabled)
- Quest Browser has native XR support built-in
- Once in Quest Browser with XR enabled, the VR/Pass-through buttons should work

## Troubleshooting

If VR button still doesn't work:
- Make sure you're using Quest Browser (not a different browser)
- Check Quest settings → System → Developer → Enable XR features
- Try refreshing the page
- Make sure Quest 3 is fully powered on and tracking is working

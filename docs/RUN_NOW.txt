# ✅ Robot is in Debug Mode - Ready to Run!

## 🚀 Run This Command Now:

source /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate xr_teleop && cd /Users/hg/Documents/barryg1/dependencies/xr_teleoperate/teleop && python teleop_hand_and_arm.py --arm=G1_23 --input-mode=hand --display-mode=immersive --img-server-ip=192.168.123.164

## 📋 What to Expect:

1. **Script starts** and initializes
2. **You should see**: `Enter debug mode: Success` (or it may skip since you're already in debug mode)
3. **You should see**: `[G1_23_ArmController] Subscribe dds ok.` (instead of "Waiting...")
4. **Script will wait** for you to press 'r' to start

## 🎮 Once Running:

1. **Press 'r'** in the terminal to start teleoperation
2. **In Quest 3 browser**, click "Virtual Reality" button
3. **Move your hands** in VR to control the robot!

## ⚠️ If You Still See "Waiting to subscribe dds...":

- Wait a bit longer - DDS connection can take 10-30 seconds
- Make sure robot's PC2 DDS service is running
- Check robot is still in debug mode

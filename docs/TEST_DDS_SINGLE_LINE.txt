# 🔍 Test DDS Connection - Single Line Command

## Your Network Interface: en7

## Test DDS Connection (Copy-Paste This):

source /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate xr_teleop && cd /Users/hg/Documents/barryg1/dependencies/unitree_sdk2_python/example/low_level && python3 lowlevel_control.py en7

## What This Does:

- Tests if you can receive low-level state data from the robot via DDS
- If it works, you'll see robot joint states, IMU data, battery voltage
- If it doesn't work, you'll see connection errors

## Expected Output (If Working):

You should see output like:
- Right front leg hip joint state
- IMU readings  
- Battery voltage
- Motor states

## If It Fails:

- Robot's DDS service may not be running
- Network interface may be wrong
- Firewall may be blocking DDS

## Quest 3 XR Errors (Normal):

The "No XR hardware found" errors are normal - you need to use Quest Browser (not regular browser) with XR enabled. The VR button should work in Quest Browser.
